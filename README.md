# Twilight ✨

Twilight is an API for developers creating plugins for Spigot or Paper based Minecraft servers. It contains a wide range of utilities and QOL improvements, from inventories, to schedulers and databases.

Twilight is built using **Kotlin**, and is recommended for usage with. Many features of Twilight should work with plain Java, though compatability is not guaranteed.

## Startup

## Features

### Extension Functions

Twilight takes advantage of Kotlin's extension functions to add additional functions to various classes used within the API:

### Events

// JOSH FILL OUT (range of custom events, plus easy custom event making?)

### Scheduler
Bukkit's build in scheduler is tedious at best, so Twilight takes advantage of beautiful Kotlin syntax to make it easier to write, as well as adding a custom TimeUnit to save you calculating ticks.

How to schedule a single task to run on Bukkit's main thread either sync or async:

```kotlin
sync {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable")
}

async {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable")
}
```

How to schedule a delayed task, with optional custom time unit and async parameters:

```kotlin
// SYNC
delay {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable delayed by 1 tick")
}

delay(10) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable delayed by 10 ticks")
}

// ASYNC
delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable delayed by 1 second")
}

delay(10, true) {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable delayed by 10 ticks")
}

delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS, true) {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable delayed by 1 second")
}
```

How to schedule a repeating task, with optional custom time unit and async parameters:
```kotlin
// SYNC
repeat(10) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable running every 10 ticks")
}

repeat(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable running every 10 seconds")
}

repeat(5, 10) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable running every 10 ticks, waiting 5 before starting")
}

repeat(5, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) {
    println("I am a sync BukkitRunnable running every 10 seconds, waiting 5 before starting")
}

// ASYNC
repeat(10, true) {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable running every 10 ticks")
}

repeat(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS, true) {
    println("I am an asyncBukkitRunnable running every 10 seconds")
}

repeat(5, 10, true) {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable running every 10 ticks, waiting 5 before starting")
}

repeat(5, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS, true) {
    println("I am an async BukkitRunnable running every 10 seconds, waiting 5 before starting")
}
```

### Databases
// JOSH FILL OUT

### UUID <--> Name
Twilight can do the heavy lifting and query the Mojang API to find the UUID from name or name from UUID of a player, particularly useful for networks. Twilight will cache responses in an attempt to not break the rate limit imposed by Mojang.

This can be used by:
// JOSH

### Symbols
Twilight offers a collection of widely used symbols within the `Symbols` object.

These are:
- • (BULLET)
- ❤ (HEART)
- ★ (STAR)
- » (SMALL_RIGHT)
- █ (SQUARE)
- ⬤ (CIRCLE)
- ⛏ (PICKAXE)
- ⛀ (COIN)
- ⛁ (COINS)

### Libraries
Comes bundled with useful librarise (gson etc) JOSH <--
